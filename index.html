        <h2>The Growing Global Warming and <br> the Role of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
        <p>Global warming has become an increasingly urgent issue over the years, with its effects becoming more apparent through rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps. The primary driver of this climate crisis is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. As human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes release ever greater amounts of CO2, the planet's natural balance is disrupted, accelerating climate change.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                <div id="vis1-1"></div>
                <script src="js/vis1-1.js"></script>
                <p>In 2023, global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry reached 37.01 billion metric tons, with projections for a 1.08% increase in 2024 to a record 37.41 billion tons. Since 1990, emissions have risen by over 60%. China is the biggest emitter, with emissions there increasing by nearly 450% since 1990, while the U.S. has seen a 6.1% decrease. Major global events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, caused emissions to drop temporarily, as seen with a 5.5% decrease in 2020, along with drops during past recessions and World War II.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

                <p> Since the 1980s, global temperatures have consistently been above average, with 2023 reaching a record high of 1.19°C above the 20th-century average. Temperature anomalies are the difference between observed and baseline temperatures, with positive anomalies indicating warmer conditions. The past decade has seen the warmest years, driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is also evident in the shrinking sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere, with regional temperature changes varying, especially between the Arctic and Antarctica.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>What Is Causing This Issue?</h2>
        <p>Among all the causes of CO2 emissions such as transport, manufacturing, and construction, the fashion industry is a significant but often overlooked contributor to global warming, responsible for up to 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions (more than international flights and shipping combined). This impact stems not only from the production processes but also from the rapid turnover of clothing in the fast fashion cycle. Microtrends, which encourage frequent consumption and disposal, mean that clothes are discarded quickly, contributing to massive amounts of textile waste. Globally, almost 87% of total fibre input is burned or ends up in a landfill where it takes centuries to break down. As textiles decompose, they release harmful greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, further exacerbating the climate crisis. This highlights the urgent need for more sustainable practices within the fashion industry to curb its environmental footprint.<br>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Fast Fashion as a Cause of Environmental Issue</h2>
        <p>Fast fashion brands like Shein and Zara have had a surge in sales over the years, driven by their ability to quickly adapt to changing trends and offer low-cost, high-volume clothing. However, this growth has come at a substantial environmental cost, particularly in the form of increased textile waste emissions. As consumer demand for affordable, trendy clothing continues to rise, these brands have scaled up production, often using materials and processes that are not sustainable. This has led to a massive accumulation of discarded garments, many of which end up in landfills or incinerators, contributing to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.<br>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>What is Driving the Increased <br> Consumption of Fast Fashion?</h2>
        <div id="intro-img">
            <img src="./img/influencer.png" alt="influencer">
        </div>
        <p>The surge in fast fashion consumption can be attributed to several key factors, with social media playing a central role in fueling this trend. Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest have transformed the way people interact with fashion, making it easier than ever to stay on top of the latest trends. Through influencers, viral challenges, and targeted advertisements, these platforms create a sense of urgency and exclusivity around clothing, encouraging constant buying and outfit turnover. Influencers and fashion bloggers often promote new, affordable styles that are quickly embraced by their massive followings, making the pressure to stay fashionable even stronger. The visual nature of social media amplifies this desire, with users continuously exposed to curated outfits, styling tips, and "must-have" items. These images often lead to impulsive purchases, as individuals strive to keep up with the rapidly changing trends they see online. The ease of access to trendy items combined with the social validation of owning the latest looks has made fast fashion a driving force in today’s consumer culture. As social media continues to push these trends, the demand for cheap, disposable fashion only grows, further accelerating the environmental crisis caused by textile waste.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                        spend on social media world wide, since social media 
                        use has also increased significally over the years.</p>

        <h2>Taking Action: <br> Solutions for Reducing Textile Waste</h2>

        <p>While textile waste is a growing problem, there are practical steps we can all take to make a difference. Start by being more mindful of what you buy. Choose high-quality, long-lasting clothes over fast fashion and consider buying second-hand or repurposing old garments. Recycling programs and clothing donations can help reduce waste, so look for opportunities to give clothes a second life.
            For businesses, adopting sustainable practices like using eco-friendly materials and promoting slow fashion can have a positive impact. Governments can also play a role by encouraging recycling initiatives and enforcing regulations to minimize waste. Small actions from individuals, brands, and governments can collectively make a big difference in tackling textile waste and protecting the environment.</p>
